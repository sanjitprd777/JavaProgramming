Java parallel stream is a feature of Java 8, it is meant for using multiple cores of the processor.

Normally, java code has one stream of processing where it is executed sequentially. By using parallel stream,
we can divide the code into multiple streams that are executed in parallel on separate cores,
and the final result is the combination of the individual outcomes.

The order of execution is not under our control.
