        ()          ->          System.out.println("Lambda Syntax");

Only for the functional interfaces we can write the lambda expression for methods.
You may annotate the class with @FunctionalInterface to force it to have only one abstract method. It can have many static
or default methods.

Helps to reduce boilerplate code. Reduce code.
