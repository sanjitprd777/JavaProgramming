Stream in Java.
Stream API is used to process a collection of objects.

A stream is a sequence of objects that supports various methods which can be pipelined to produce a desire result.

Stream is not data structures; it takes input from collection, array or I/O channel.

It does not change the original data, it provides the result as per pilelined methods.

Why we need it?
- Achieve functional programming
- Code reduce
- Bulk operations

Methods:
Filter - for conditional check (Supports consumer functional interface)
forEach - For iteration (Supports predicate functional interface)
